This thesis investigates how a bidirectional, heart rate-driven adaptive music system affects player engagement in horror games. Traditional adaptive music responds to in-game events, but physiological signals may enable more personalized experiences. A custom 3D horror game was developed with two conditions: a control group where music and enemy encounters were triggered by predefined events, and an experimental group where both adapted to players' heart rates in real-time. Heart rate data was collected using a Pulse Sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. Fifteen participants from Drexel University were randomly assigned to either condition. Results revealed higher engagement scores in the experimental group (mean 6.00) compared to the control group (mean 4.86). Paradoxically, perceptions of music adaptiveness were higher in the control group, suggesting event-driven changes were more noticeable than physiological adaptations. The findings indicate heart rate-driven systems can increase engagement but require more transparent implementation to be fully effective.
